- [ ] please add this to the project "documentation" (and then delete this)

This is the ticket used to track issues/topics that need to go in the section of the manual that discusses [insert heading/topic here]. 
Currently we are envisioning this section under [either basic recording stuff, recording software, or Kiosk] --> [this is where the subsection title goes, if there is one].

### Related tickets in the documentation project:

### Categories of documentation needed for this:
<!-- remove the ones that are not needed! --> 

- text
- images <!-- what types of images would be useful? -->
- video

<!-- 
if necessary/helpful, add comments on things to remember when writing up this section -- e.g., the section on QR codes needs to include not only a bit about how they function in the recording system itself but also about the upload to the file repository
-->
